# SIMON Memory Game 

SIMON is a game that creates sequences of sounds and lights and requires a player to repeat the sequence. If the player succeeds, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex until the game ends at level 20. The game consists of two modes normal and strict, on strict mode if the player makes a mistake they must restart from level 1.

## Features

The game has several features:
    - Two modes: normal and strict.
    - randomly generated sequences of light and sound.
    - A timer which lets the user know their time when they complete the game.
    - A mistake counter which tells the user the number of errors they made in normal mode.
