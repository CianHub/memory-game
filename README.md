# SIMON Memory Game 

SIMON is a game that creates sequences of sounds and lights and requires a player to repeat the sequence. If the player succeeds, the sequence becomes progressively longer and more complex until the game ends at level 10. The game consists of two modes normal and strict, on strict mode if the player makes a mistake they must restart from level 1.

## Features

The game has several features:

    1. Two modes: normal and strict.
    2. Sequences are represented by combinations of light and sound.
    3. The duration of the game is stored in a timer and shown to the player upon completion.
    4. A mistake counter tells the player the number of errors they made in normal mode upon completion.
    5. In normal mode the player can make an unlimited number of mistakes.
    6. In strict mode the game restarts after the player makes an error.
